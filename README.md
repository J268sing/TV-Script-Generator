Programmed and trained a deep learning Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for generating small dialogue for a Simpson's TV script. It included preprocessing the data with word embedding and tokenising punctuation and training the RNN by sequence batching and encoding, as well as hyperparameter tunning.
